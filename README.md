# FriendFinder

FriendFinder is an application that not only helps you find friends, but it also utilizes the node module express to handle routing.
Upon loading the app, the user may opt to take a survey, which will ask them a few questions. After answering these questions, they will be presented with their new friend, who has the closest score to theirs.
